					<p> As a research assistant for Laura Newburgh (Assistant Professor of Physics at the time), I developed devices and configured software to optimize a calibration noise source for <a class="text-link" href="https://chime-experiment.ca/">CHIME.</a>  The CHIME interferometer looks far out into space to observe hydrogen gas in galaxies that are strongly affected by "Dark Energy", the driver of the accelerating expansion of our universe.

				<p> Because of the size of the CHIME instrument (4 x 100x20 meter cylindrical reflectors), it is impossible to isolate all of the components from the natural elements.  This causes variablity in the scientific measurements on site that are difficult to correct and correctly calibrate for.  The solution to this issue was to develop a noise source which will be mounted on a GPS-guided drone and flown above the interferometer's recievers to calibrate them.  Because the noise source is small, we control its critical conditions, such as its temperature, rather than those of the entire CHIME site. </p>
				<p> To prepare the source for operation at the site, its signal strength and variability on ambient temperature had to be determined.  I collaborated with project members in Toronto, Canada, to design and develop a data analysis pipeline at Yale University.  This pipeline is a scale device of the much larger FX-correlator at the CHIME site.  My pipeline utilized a FPGA and GPU, integrated with a custom computer that I constructed, to mirror the data acquisition and analysis process at CHIME.  The pipeline's computations were accelerated using parallel processing technologies originally developed for CHIME.  I constructed most of the hardware for the pipeline, including a high-precision temperature sensor using an Arduino micro-controller, as well as performed systems administration duties for the pipeline to allow project members remote access from Toronto. </p>

					<p> During the summer of 2017, I assisted an amazing team of astronomers led by Professor Debra Fischer to commission the <a class="text-link" href="http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/expresBlog/">EXPRES spectrograph</a> to the Discovery Channel Telescope in Flagstaff, AZ.  I mainly assisted graduate student Ryan Petersburg in developing a software analysis package to analyze scientific properties of the fiber optic cables that transport light from the telescope to the spectrograph. </p>
