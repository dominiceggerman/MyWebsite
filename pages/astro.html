				<!-- Intro paragraphs -->
				<div class="col-wide">
					<p> As a research assistant for Laura Newburgh (Assistant
					Professor of Physics at the time) during my senior thesis, I
					developed devices and software to optimize a calibration
					noise source for <a class="text-link"
					href="https://chime-experiment.ca/">CHIME.</a>  The CHIME
					interferometer looks far out into space to observe hydrogen
					gas in galaxies that are strongly affected by "Dark Energy",
					the driver of the accelerating expansion of our universe.
					The experiment hopes to measure the Baryon Acoustic
					Oscillations in the large distributions of hydrogen, and
					create a standard ruler to measure the expansion rate of our
					universe. </p>

				<p> Because of the size of the CHIME instrument (4 x 100x20
				meter cylindrical reflectors), it is impossible to isolate all
				of the components from the natural elements.  This causes
				variablity in the scientific measurements on site that are
				difficult to correct and correctly calibrate for.  The solution
				to this issue was to develop a noise source which will be
				mounted on a GPS-guided drone and flown above the
				interferometer's recievers to calibrate them.  Because the noise
				source is small, we control its critical conditions, such as its
				temperature, rather than those of the entire CHIME site. </p>
				<p> To prepare the source for operation at the site, its signal
				strength and variability on ambient temperature had to be
				determined.  I collaborated with project members in Toronto,
				Canada, to design and develop a data analysis pipeline at Yale
				University.  This pipeline is a scale device of the much larger
				FX-correlator at the CHIME site.  My pipeline utilized a FPGA
				and GPU, integrated with a custom computer that I constructed,
				to mirror the data acquisition and analysis process at CHIME.
				The pipeline's computations were accelerated using parallel
				processing technologies originally developed for CHIME.  I
				constructed most of the hardware for the pipeline, including a
				high-precision temperature sensor using an Arduino
				micro-controller, as well as performed systems administration
				duties to allow project members remote access from Toronto. </p>
				<p> This background is a photograph of one of the two shipping
				containers at CHIME.  Each container houses 128 GPU's to process
				data in the second stage of CHIME's correlator. </p>

					<h3> EXtreme PREcision Spectrometer (EXPRES) </h3>

				<!-- Intro paragraphs -->
				<div class="col-wide">
					<p> During the summer of 2017, I assisted an amazing team of
					astronomers led by Professor Debra Fischer and Senior
					Research Scientist Colby Jurgenson to commission the
					<a class="text-link"
					href="http://exoplanets.astro.yale.edu/expresBlog/">EXPRES</a>
					to the Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT) in Flagstaff, AZ.
					EXPRES aims to use its extraordinary resolution, wavelength
					coverage, and a cutting-edge laser frequency comb to detect
					100 earth-like planets outside of our solar system.  It also
					hopes to achieve unparalleled accuracy when it comes to
					measuring radial velocity (Doppler) shifts in distant stars,
					and set a precedent for future astronomical instruments.
					</p>
				</div>

				<p> EXPRES uses fiber optic cables to feed the light collected
				by the DCT to the spectrograph.  This allows for the instrument
				to be vacuum enclosed and cryogenically controlled to isolate it
				from sources of error.  The fibers however have there own
				sources of error.  EXPRES uses multi-mode fibers, meaning there
				are multiple electro-magnetic modes (or paths more simply) for
				light to propagate along as it travels down the fiber.  The
				interference of these modes between each other as light
				propagates is known as modal noise.  Modal noise has adverse
				affects on the accuracy of the radial velocity measurements of
				stars, as a circular input source exits in the downstream fiber
				end as a speckle pattern in the fiber face (see publication for
				images).  This speckle pattern depends on the geometric
				arrangement of the fiber, and any microscopic change can
				generate a unique pattern and throw off analysis results.
				</p>
				<p> During my involvement with EXPRES, I assisted graduate
				student Ryan Petersburg to develop a <a class="text-link"
				href="https://github.com/rpetersburg/fiber_properties">software
				analysis package</a> to analyze scientific properties of the
				fiber optic cables, including modal noise.  We showed that modal
				noise was best mitigated by chaotically agitating (using various
				oscillating apparatus) the fiber as light was propagating in it.
				Moving the optical cable into various positions as a camera is
				taking an image allows it to take up a huge array of geometric
				configurations.  In return, the light exits the cable as a
				"smoothed-out" speckle pattern that reduces the radial velocity
				errors.  The extended details of the methods and results of our
				work were published in 2018. </p>
				<p> During the project, I tested the "science" fibers that were
				installed at the operation site.  I also performance-tested
				devices for the spectrograph such as the cutting-edge double
				scrambler / pupil slicer.  I developed scripts in SQL to manage,
				query, and graph results of the cryostat temperature sensor
				array.  Overall, EXPRES was a truely amazing (perfect)
				undergraduate research project made possible by an incredible
				team of scientists and friends. </p>

					<h3> Argos </h3>
					<h4> <em> May 2015 - April 2017 </em> </h4>
				</div>
				<!-- Intro paragraphs -->
				<div class="col-wide">
					<p> For two of my undergraduate years, I worked under
					Professor Meg Urry and Grant Tremblay (now an Astrophysist
					at the Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics at Harvard
					University).  Here began my love for coding as I developed a
					data analysis toolkit (nicknamed <a class="text-link"
					href="https://github.com/dominiceggerman/Argos">Argos</a>)
					in Python which produces high-resolution contour maps of
					various gas properties (temperature, pressure, entropy etc.)
					for galaxies in the Chandra X-Ray Telescope database. </p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<!-- Additional paragraphs -->
			<div>
				<p> In the summer of my freshman year, I taught myself to code
				in Python.  I began implementing the existing data reduction and
				analysis procedures into code so that they could be automated
				for a wide range of targets in the Chandra Database.  Using the
				automated package, we would search for "hot-arcs" of gas in
				galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).  AGN are
				supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies that create
				an extemely lumnious region as they accrete (draw in) matter. As
				the infalling matter travels towards the black hole, some of it
				can be ejected back into the host galaxy in relativistic jets.
				The AGN ejections are more active depending on how much matter
				the black hole is accreting.  When these ejections happen, gas
				is blown in a shockwave front out to Megaparsec scales (1 Mpc =
				3,260,000 light years).  At the right orientation, the shock
				fronts can be seen using the Chandra X-Ray Telescope.  The
				package I created can then analyze an image of the galaxy and
				calculate the temperature of the shock front and the hot gas
				that rushes back into the void behind it.  For active galaxies,
				this information can be used to chart a history of black hole
				accretion / matter ejection activity, based on the properties
				and dynamics of the shock. These ejetion events also serve to
				dynamically heat gas in active galaxies. </p>
				<p> The analysis code I created implements various astronomical
				tools, such as CIAO, DS9, Sherpa, and XSpec to perform analysis
				and modeling.  I spent a large part of my undergrauate time on
				Argos because it needed a ground-up re-write during my sophomore
				summer.  This was because 1) CIAO, the main analysis software,
				underwent a significant update and 2) I had written the code as
				I was learning, so it wasn't pretty.  I eventually used the
				Argos analysis procedures to contribute to a major publication
				with Dr. Tremblay. </p>
				<p> This background is a NASA composite image of Messier 81
				(M81), one of the first galaxies I analyzed to calibrate the
				models used in Argos.  M81 has an Active Galactic Nucleus
				harboring a 70 million solar mass black hole. </p>
